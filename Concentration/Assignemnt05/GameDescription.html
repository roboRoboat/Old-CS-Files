<h1>How to play Concentration</h1>

<h2>Game Rules:</h2>
  <p>Concentration is a card game that will test your memory and be bundles of fun!</p>

<h2>Object of the Game</h2>
	<p>The goal of Concentration is to find the most matching pairs of cards.</p>
	
<h2>Rules and Setup</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Materials Needed for Play</h3></li>
			<p>Concentration can be played with a standard deck of cards, but can also be played with decks of cards that are designed especially for the game.</p>
		<li><h3>Number of Players</h3></li>
			<p>Concentration can be played solo, or it can be played with any number of people. It can be played as individuals or in teams.</p>
		<li><h3>Game Setup</h3></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Shuffle the deck of cards</li>
				<li>Lay all of the cards on the table or playing surface face down.</li>
				<li>Decide who goes first if playing with others. (I recommend choosing whoever's birthday is soonest)</li>
				<li>The first player picks two cards and turns only those two cards over.</li>
				<li>If the cards match, the player removes them from the play area and sets the pair aside. <br>
					If the cards do not match, they are turned back over and the next player chooses two cards.</li>
				<li>Play continues until all cards have been removed from play</li>	
			</ol>
