<h1>Design Doc</h1>
<p>This is the outline of my plan and progress of where I'm at and where I need to go in order to get my game of Concentration 
completely finished.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<h3>Attributes of the Game</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Timer: Tracks how long the game has gone on</li>
		<li>Score: Tracks how many matches have been made so far</li>
		<li>Grid: A yet to be decided grid of cards that all look the same when face down</li>
		<li>Cards: A yet to be decided number of different cards, each of which needs a match</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Timer</h3>
<p>I've tested out some basic timer functions, but haven't quite gotten one to work the way I want.<br>
	The timer will start when the page loads and end when the game finshes. I would like to have page
	fade out and display a large congratulations/condolences message with the user's time. It would also 
	be neat to have a leaderboard...</p>

<h3>Score</h3>
	<p>This should be some fairly straightforward logic. What this will do is track how many matches the player has made so far.</p>
	
<h3>The Grid</h3>
	<p>The grid will probably be a 4x4 table. Easier to program and easier to match the cards. We need to have an even number
		of cards so that pairs can be made.</p>
		
<h3>Cards</h3>
	<p>16 cards, and when face down, all look the same</p>
	<h4>Functions/Events</h4>
	<p class="list">
		flipCard(); -- The most complicated bit, I think. This will need to have a few things 
			<ul style="margin-left:50px">
				<li>When clicked, a card flips</li>
				<li>The card stays flipped until another card is flipped</li>
				<li><b>If match</b></li>
				<li>---Cards stay turned over</li>
				<li><b>If no match</b></li>
				<li>---Cards must stay turned over for a second, and then turn back face down</li>
				<li><b>Have the basic flip animations figured out, just need to implement in the table</b></li>
			</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="list">startTime(); -- This will start the timer. Will need to start the timer when the page is loaded, 
		and end when game is done.</p> 
	<p class="list">endTime(); -- May not need a separate function for endTime... </p>
	<p class="list">countScore(); -- This funtion will keep a count of the user's current number of matches. </p>
	<p class="list">endGame(); -- End the game, display congratulations message, log user score in scoreboard if possible.</p>
